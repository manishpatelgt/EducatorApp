[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This Android App developed using Kotlin as primary language. App is useful for student who can easily search videos based subject and his/her favorite educator and watch it.
Also, anyone can comment, like and rate educator video.

I have used Firebase database and firebase storage for videos, icons and other resources. I don't use my own server here.

# Features

1) Login with Google
2) Select your subject and favorite educator and watch his/her video and like it
3) Saved your favorite videos and you can directly play it
4) You can comment and rate educator videos
5) Give us feedback

**More Features coming soon...**
