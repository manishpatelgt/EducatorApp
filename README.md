This Android App developed using Kotlin as primary language. App is useful for student who can easily search videos based subject and his/her favorite educator and watch it.
Also, anyone can comment, like and rate educator video.

I have used Firebase database and firebase storage for videos, icons and other resources. I don't use my own server here.

5) Give us feedback

**More Features coming soon...**
